Welcome to my I4 DOHC Engine project corner! This is a learning journey where I'm exploring the inner workings of a 4-cylinder, dual overhead camshaft (DOHC) internal combustion (IC) engine through:

* Written Report: detailing how an engine operates, following how technological advancements helped develop the IC engine 
* Free-hand Technical Drawings: sketching key working components of the engine 
* 3D Models in SOLIDWORKS: creating parts and assemblies using SOLIDWORKS from the technical drawings 

# Motivation 

* Interest in cars and powertrain systems
* Worked three 4-month co-op terms in automotive manufacturing

# Project Goals

* Understand IC engines in a technical, historical, and socioeconomic aspect
* Understand how individual engine parts work and how each component drives the engine system as a whole
* Integrate engine parts and assembly
* Improve visualization and free-hand technical sketching skills
* Improve 3D modelling skills using SOLIDWORKS 

# Deliverables

* Report
* Drawings
* 3d models

# Tools Used

* Research and study 
* Pencil and paper for drawings
* SOLIDWORKS 

# Challenges

* Difficulty visualizing engine parts and assemblies due to having never seen an engine in real life
* Discrepancies between technical drawings ie. measurements of one part not fully accounted for design of other part

# Future Work

* Design study / FEA 
* Motion study
* 3D printing
* Cost and performance efficiency real-world modelling 

# For You

Feel free to read through the report as well as download parts and assemblies!
